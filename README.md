## Project objectives üéØ:
Determination of toxicity comments
## Brief conclusion from the project‚úçÔ∏è:
During the study, text features were processed and encoded using the BERT model, then three machine learning models were trained - CatBoost, LightGBM and LogisticRegression, according to the results of testing of which, the best LogisticRegression model was selected, the final quality indicator of which, according to the F1 metric, was 0.75.
